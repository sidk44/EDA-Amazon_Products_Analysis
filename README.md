# Amazon_Products_Sales_Analysis
In this project, I conducted Data Analysis on an Amazon products sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. This project includes data preprocessing, data cleaning and data manipulation.  The bar plots and word clouds, provide an understanding of key metrics and trends and visualize meaningful textual patterns within the dataset. The robust combination of data preprocessing and visualization techniques help us to understand and analyze the dataset thoroughly.
